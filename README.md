# Weather CLI

Weather CLI is a command-line application for retrieving weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Fetch weather details for specific locations**: This CLI uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide weather updates.
- **Multilingual support**: The CLI supports multiple languages. Configure the desired language using the `-lang` flag (e.g., `-lang en` for English or `-lang ru` for Russian).
- **Flexible updates**: Get weather updates either as a one-time output or at regular intervals using the `-ntf` flag.
- **Console output or notifications**: View weather updates directly in the console or as system notifications (e.g., macOS notifications).
